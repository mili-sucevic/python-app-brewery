# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# SOLUTION 1
days = 365
weeks = 52
months = 12

result = 90 - int(age)
result_days = int(result) * int(days)
result_weeks = int(result) * int(weeks)
result_months = int(result) * int(months)

print(f"You have {result_days} days, {result_weeks} weeks, and {result_months} months left.")

# SOLUTION 2
age_as_int = int(age)

years_remaining = 90 - age_as_int
days_remaining = years_remaining * 365
weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
months_remaining = years_remaining * 12

print(f"You have {days_remaining} days, {weeks_remaining} weeks, and {months_remaining} months left.")

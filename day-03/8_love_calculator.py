# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 

# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 

# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times

# R occurs 1 time

# U occurs 2 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time

# O occurs 0 times

# V occurs 0 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53

# Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
# name1 = "Kanye West"
# name2 = "Kim Kardashian"
# Example Output 1
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# name1 = "Brad Pitt"
# name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
# Example Output 2
# Your score is 73.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# Add two names together
combined_string = name1 + name2
# print(combined_string)

# Turn both names into lower case letters
lower_case_string = combined_string.lower()
# print(lower_case_string)

# The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
t = lower_case_string.count("t")
r = lower_case_string.count("r")
u = lower_case_string.count("u")
e = lower_case_string.count("e")

true = t + r + u + e
# print(true)

# The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
l = lower_case_string.count("l")
o = lower_case_string.count("o")
v = lower_case_string.count("v")
e = lower_case_string.count("e")

love = l + o + v + e
# print(love)

# True and love are integers
# print(type(true))

# To be able to concatenate them together turn them into strings 
love_score = str(true) + str(love)

# Convert the love_score back into an integer to compare below against numbers/integers
int_score = int(love_score)

if (int_score < 10) or (int_score > 90):
    print(f"Your score is {int_score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif (int_score >= 40) and (int_score <= 50):
    print(f"Your score is {int_score}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {int_score}")
